# How to play Wordle
<p>The Wordle instructions are simple. You have six chances to guess the daily, five-letter word. To kick off the game, you must input your first five-letter guess. Once you've done this, Wordle will help you along with color-coded hints.</p>

<p>If a letter is highlighted in green, it means that it's placed in the correct spot in correspondence with the daily word. If the letter is highlighted in yellow, this signifies that this letter is featured in the daily word, but it's not in the correct spot. Gray indicates that the letter is not in the target word at all.</p>
